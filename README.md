# CMPG-323-Project-One
Agile &amp; Scrum Implementation

This project is a workflow management project and I will be using it to plan out my workflow throughout the semester. I plan on updating it with every sprint when I plan out my work week. I will be using this approach because experience has taught me that planning out my whole semester never really works out compared to planning my week. So, with the agile approach I believe I'll achive my weekly goals.
